Phase 1: Planning and Requirements
Define Features

User authentication and account management.
Scheduling and hosting meetings.
Real-time video and audio streaming.
Chat functionality (group/private).
Screen sharing and file sharing.
Breakout rooms.
Recording functionality.
Notifications and reminders.
Technology Stack

Frontend: React/Next.js, Redux (or Context API) for state management.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL for user data and meeting records.
Video SDK: WebRTC, or third-party APIs like Twilio Video, Agora, or Vonage.
Cloud Services: AWS (S3 for file storage, EC2 for deployment), Firebase for real-time database if needed.
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines.
Phase 2: UI/UX Design
Wireframes and Mockups

Design screens for login/signup, dashboard, meeting room, and settings.
Tools: Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch.
User Flow

Optimize navigation for ease of use (e.g., one-click meeting join).
Focus on responsiveness and accessibility.
Branding

Choose a clean and professional theme.
Phase 3: Backend Development
Setup Server

Build a RESTful API with Express.js for managing users, meetings, and sessions.
Secure the server with HTTPS, CORS policies, and rate limiting.
Database Design

Create schemas for:
Users: { id, name, email, passwordHash, profileImage }
Meetings: { id, hostId, participants, startTime, duration }
Chat Messages: { id, meetingId, senderId, message, timestamp }
Authentication

Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
Implement OAuth 2.0 for login via Google, Facebook, etc.
Real-Time Communication

Implement WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for chat and live updates.
Phase 4: Frontend Development
Setup Project

Use React/Next.js for dynamic routing and component-based structure.
Integrate TailwindCSS/Material-UI for styling.
Dashboard

Create user dashboards to display upcoming meetings, recent activity, and settings.
Meeting Room

Build a dedicated room for video/audio calls.
Implement controls for mute/unmute, video on/off, and chat.
Integrate SDKs

Use WebRTC or third-party SDKs (Twilio/Agora) for real-time video/audio.
Responsive Design

Ensure all pages work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Phase 5: Real-Time Features
Video and Audio Streaming

Configure STUN and TURN servers for WebRTC.
Handle low-latency streaming and bandwidth adaptation.
Chat

Implement group and private chat using WebSockets.
Screen Sharing

Utilize WebRTCâ€™s screen-sharing API.
Notifications

Set up push notifications for meeting reminders using Firebase or OneSignal.
Phase 6: Advanced Features
Meeting Scheduling

Allow users to schedule meetings with calendar integration (e.g., Google Calendar API).
Recording

Enable meeting recordings and store them on AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage.
Breakout Rooms

Allow the host to split participants into smaller groups.
Admin Controls

Add features like muting participants, managing access, and kicking out users.
Phase 7: Testing
Unit and Integration Testing

Use Jest/Mocha for backend and React Testing Library for frontend.
End-to-End Testing

Test real-time features with tools like Cypress or Selenium.
Load Testing

Use tools like JMeter to test system scalability.
Phase 8: Deployment
Backend Deployment

Host on AWS/GCP/Azure or use Heroku for quick deployment.
Frontend Deployment

Deploy on Vercel/Netlify for fast builds and CDN support.
CI/CD Pipelines

Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
Phase 9: Maintenance and Updates
Monitor Performance

Use tools like New Relic or Datadog.
Bug Fixes and Updates

Release periodic updates with new features or optimizations.
Scalability

Scale infrastructure to handle increased users using Kubernetes or serverless architecture.
